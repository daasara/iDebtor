HOW TO DEPLOY
1.Check for a Python 3 installation in your machine by running python3 on the terminal. If python3 is installed, you can skip to step 4. Otherwise follow the guide step by step
2. Install Python3 on your machine 
    [sudo apt-get install python3 for Ubuntu]
3. You can ensure that your Python is installed correctly by opening terminal (Bash) 
    and running python3.
    You should get an output like: 
        Python 3.5.2 (default, Nov 17 2016, 17:05:23) 
        [GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>> 


4. Type exit() to quit the python interpreter.
5. Install PIP (The python package manager) with the following command:
    sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
    
    Syntax for using pip is pip install [packagename] where [packagename] is the name of the package. i.e,
    pip install django -> would download the latest version of django and install it on the system.
6.Set up a Virtual Environment to run your code within
    Command is : sudo apt install -y python3-venv
7.Create a folder that shall hold the Virtual environment files
    mkdir environments
    and navigate to it.
    cd environments
8. Then create your environment by issuing:
    pyvenv myenv -> where myvenv is the name of your Virtual Environment
9. issuing ls myenv shall list all the directories within the myenv folder(environment).
    The output shall be as follows:
        bin include lib lib64 pyvenv.cfg share
10. Time to activate our environment
    source myenv/bin/activate 
    shall activate the environment, and your terminal shall look like:
    (my_env) dev@devserver:~/environments$
11. You can either download this repo or clone it.
12. Once you have downloaded the repo, extract it and navigate to the 
    src/ folder. 
13. On your terminal type
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    This shall install the dependencies for this app.
14. Once pip has finished installing the dependencies,
    run
    python3 manage.py runserver [host][port]
    Where [host] is your IP
    and [port] is the port on which it should run on.

You can access the landing page at http:[host][port]
Log in using the username and password stored in the POSTGRESQL DB running on the Server. [Usernames and passwords are predefined on the Remote DB Server].
If user does not have Login credentials on the server, they can create credentials by issuing
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
